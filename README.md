## SkyRating
SkyRating developed for an unattended coding test for Sky. User can upload a file in the .xml file format and content is displayed. User is then invited to rate the content on a star based system. The content is then ordered and displayed on a Leaderbord.

## Installation
Either unzip, or fork from GitHub.

## Usage
Navigate to unzipped folder or forked repo and run `python run.py`

## Future Work
 - Implement full database system
 - Allow users to append to data file rather than overwrite current
 - Allow users to vote by clicking on the desired number of stars (use some kind of jQuery plugin for this)
